## Welcome to my GitHub page

I'm Jakob, a biologist-turned-programmer, happy in my role as a research software engineer.

I work as an assistant professor at [CPR, Copenhagen University](https://www.cpr.ku.dk/) researching metagenomics with particular interest in virus- and plasmid metagenomics. Biologically, my interests are in phylogenetics, molecular evolution and sub-genomic replicons. On the computer science side, I'm a Julia, Rust and Python enthusiast, contributing to [BioJulia](https://biojulia.net/) and [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). I particularly enjoy writing optimized and generic software packages for bioinformatics.
