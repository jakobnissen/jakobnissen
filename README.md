## Welcome to my GitHub page

I'm Jakob, a biologist-turned-programmer, happy in my role as a research software engineer.

I've done my PhD in [metagenomic binning](https://github.com/RasmussenLab/vamb), and now do a post doc at [Statens Serum Institut](https://github.com/ssi-dk) (Danish CDC) researching the zoonotic and pandemic potential of influenza virus. Biologically, my interests are in phylogenetics (wished I knew more about it!), molecular evolution and microbial genomics. On the computer science side, I'm a Julia and Python enthusiast, contributing to [BioJulia](https://biojulia.net/) and [Julia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia). I particularly enjoy writing optimized and generic software packages for bioinformatics.
